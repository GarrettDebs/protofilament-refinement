## Protofilament refinement

Software package to further refine microtubule structures, by aligning individual protofilaments rather than full microtubule segements.

Currently, this program assumes that you have already refined your microtubule structures to a moderately high resolution. A full microtubule refinement suite may be further developed in the future.

## Installation

The recommended mode of installation is to install the program within a conda environment.

```bash
git clone XXXX
cd protofilament-refinement
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pf_refinement
python setup.py install
```
